** Past Interests

I received B.Eng. from the Faculty of Engineering, University of Tokyo.
I was in [[http://save.sys.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/index_e.html][Yoshimura & Izmi Lab]], whose members are mainly interested in FEM/MPS and /Traffic Simulation/.

My graduate thesis was about using RRT-based agents for generating
the cooperative behaviors in the traffic simulation. (The paper is in
Japanese, so I do not provide it here.)

** Hobby / Personal Activity

+ Programming Language and Common Lisp
+ Electric circuits and Microcontroller
  + I have worked on a bipedal robot in the past
