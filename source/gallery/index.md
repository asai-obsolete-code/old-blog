-   2010 Apr: Bought a Miata MX-5 1.8L NA8('97)
    -   Compression Ratio 9.0, ~130ps
-   2010 Dec: Stock ECU -> Custom ECU Flash-ROM
    -   Bought a general-purpose flash-ROM writer from <http://www.sivava.com/>
    -   [Created my own fuel-mapping&ignition timing software](../editor/editor.html)
-   2012 June: Engine Swap:
    -   Miata MX-5 1.8L NB8('00) Stock
        -   Variable Resonance Intake
        -   Since my custom ECU works only for old engine, 
            I had to make a [Resonance Intake Controller using Arduino](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l46wbUEi5YU)
            in order to get the advantage of new engine
        -   Compression Ratio 9.5
        -   ~145ps
    -   plus DIY high-compression (9.5 -> 10.1)
        -   0.7mm face-milling on cylinder head
        -   ~155ps?
